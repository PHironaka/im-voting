IT FEELS LIKE A CHORE. WORSE, IT FEELS LIKE A WASTE OF TIME. HOW DO YOU KNOW YOUR VOTE MATTERS? HOW DO YOU KNOW IT’S EVEN BEING COUNTED? THESE ARE FAIR QUESTIONS — ONES WE CONTINUE TO ASK OURSELVES AS WELL. </p><p>BUT HERE’S WHAT WE DO KNOW: IN 2014, ONLY 37% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS AND ONLY 19% OF 18-29 YEAR OLDS VOTED. THAT MEANS A LOT OF US LET A SMALL GROUP SPEAK FOR US, ABOUT WHAT MATTERS MOST TO US. OUR GENERATION DOESN’T LET THAT HAPPEN WHEN IT COMES TO DEBATES OVER SPORTS OR RAP BEEF, SO WHY WOULD WE WHEN IT COMES TO CHOOSING LOCAL, STATE, OR NATIONAL REPRESENTATIVES WHO DECIDE ON EVERYTHING FROM POTHOLES GETTING FIXED ON YOUR STREET TO ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH INSURANCE TO HOW OUR NEIGHBORHOODS ARE KEPT SAFE?</p><p>WE SHOULDN’T. WE WON’T—RIGHT?</p><p>WE ALSO KNOW PEOPLE WON’T MOVE UNTIL THEY SEE OTHERS MOVE, WHETHER WE’RE TALKING ABOUT PROTESTING OR SHIGGY’S NEW DANCE CHALLENGE. PEOPLE WON’T VOTE UNTIL THEY SEE OTHERS AROUND THEM DO IT. AND WE KNOW BY THE TIME YOU SEE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE POST THEIR “I VOTED” STICKERS, IT’S A WRAP — NO ONE IS RUNNING DOWN TO THE POLLS TO CAST A VOTE.</p><p>SO WE BUILT THIS THING. SO YOU CAN UPLOAD A PHOTO AND CHANGE YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA PROFILE PICS SO YOU CAN SHOW THE WORLD YOU’RE SHOWING UP… AND VOTING. AND MAYBE, JUST MAYBE OTHERS WILL TAKE NOTICE AND DECIDE TO SHOW UP THEMSELVES.<p> <p>IT DOESN’T STOP HERE. CONSIDER THIS AN OPEN INVITATION TO CONTRIBUTE TO A DIALOGUE THAT SHOULD BE HAPPENING 365 DAYS (366 IN THAT LEAP YEAR, WORD TO HOV’S 2ND VERSE ON BEACH CHAIR), ELECTION YEAR OR NOT.</p><p>SINCERELY,</p><p>AMERICA</p><p>NEED HELP? A FEW RESOURCES WE FOUND HELPFUL:</p><h2> HOW DO I ACTUALLY VOTE?</h2> <a href="https://www.vote.org/" target="_blank">VOTE.ORGr</a> <ul> <li> GO TO VOTE.ORG AND CHECK YOUR VOTER REGISTRATION STATUS BEFORE TUESDAY. IF YOU’VE MISSED AN ELECTION OR TWO, YOUR REGISTRATION MIGHT’VE BEEN PURGED. (IT’S SOME BULLSHIT) </li><li> LOOK UP YOUR POLLING PLACE (WHERE YOU GO VOTE) AND DOUBLE CHECK THE HOURS. </li><li> CHECK IF YOUR STATE OFFERS EARLY VOTING. IT IT DOES, AVOID THE LINES (THERE WILL BE LINES)! </li></ul> <h2> WHO OR WHAT AM I VOTING FOR AGAIN?</h2> <a href="https://www.ballotready.org/" target="_blank">BALLOTREADY.ORG</a> <ul> <li>YOU GOTTA KNOW WHAT YOU’RE VOTING FOR — THE PEOPLE AND THE MEASURES. HONESTLY, FINDING THIS INFO IS TOUGH, BUT WE FOUND BALLOTREADY.ORG TO BE THE MOST HELPFUL. YOU CAN MAKE A SAMPLE BALLOT TO PRINT OUT OR SAVE ON YOUR PHONE AS A “CHEAT SHEET” IN THE VOTING BOOTH. ALSO, GOOGLE YOUR LOCAL NEWSPAPER — THEY SHOULD HAVE A GOOD BREAKDOWN FOR YOU. </li></ul> <h2> HOW DO I CONVINCE MY FRIENDS TO VOTE?</h2> <a href="https://votewithme.us/" target="_blank">VOTEWITHME APP</a> <ul> <li> WANT AN EASY WAY TO REMIND FRIENDS? DOWNLOAD THE <a href="https://votewithme.us/" target="_blank">VOTEWITHME APP</a> AND REMIND 5 FRIENDS. </li><li>IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS, ASK A FRIEND — THEY’RE PROBABLY IN THE SAME BOAT. OR REACH OUT TO ME AND LET’S FIGURE IT OUT TOGETHER. </li></ul> <p> THANK YOU. </p></div></div></div><script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha256-3edrmyuQ0w65f8gfBsqowzjJe2iM6n0nKciPUp8y+7E=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="html2canvas.min.js"></script> <script src="FileSaver.min.js"></script> <script src="vote.js"></script> </body></html>
